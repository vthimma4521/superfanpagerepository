	<h1>Ghost of Tsushima: A Cinematic Masterpiece</h1>
		<p>This webpage covers all the lore, game dynamics, scenery, and any other details that I liked from this masterpiece. Enjoy, and I hope this page convinces you to give it a try!</p>
	<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is a <em>PS4</em> exclusive game set in 1274 B.C.E. on the tiny island of <em>Tsushima</em> off the coast of Japan. The game covers the Mongol invansion of Japan, which, although highly dramatized and fictionalized here, actually is based off real events - after most of his ~80 Samurai bretheren are killed on the banks of <em>Komoda Beach</em>, it is up to Sakai to stop the Mongols before they reach the mainland, and save is people while at it. Playing as seasoned Samurai Jin Sakai, players must face a grueling campaign as Sakai saves his uncle, challenges hoards of bloodthirsty Mongols, learns a whole hoast of different fighting stances and weapons, and becomes the <em>Ghost</em> to defeat Khotun Khan. </p>
		<p>Players are also treated to great side stories and a customizable skill tree, weapons menu, adaptable stances, and feature-specific and upgradable outfits. Part of Jin Sakai's character arc is the balance between upholding <em>bushido</em> as a honorable Samurai and taking on <em>oni</em>-like attributes as the legendary <em>Ghost</em>. Sakai trains with many <em>senseis</em> that affect his viewpoint on these matters, along with making many allies from unlikely places across the island; all of these people help him shape his thoughts on how best to save his community. Sakai must also address his past as the last of the <em>Sakai</em> clan, and the potential successor to <em>Lord Shimura</em>, his uncle and <em>Jito</em> of the island.</p>
		<p>This game was a pleasure to play, a true-love letter to rich story-based games, 50s-60s Samurai flicks along the lines of <em>Kurosawa's</em> "Seven Samurai", and the Samurai culture of days past. I' d rate it a 10/10, and I only give very few properties this rating. Personally, this story, its characters, scenery, and its acting hit so hard because it resonated so much with my life - I am obviously no battle-hardened Samurai, but I feel as though the core themes of the story are relatable, and the events in the story imitate life in a way few videogames have done before. I hope you decide to check out <em>Ghost of Tsushima,&nbsp; </em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
