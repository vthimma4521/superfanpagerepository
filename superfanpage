	<h1>A Cinematic Masterpiece: Ghost of Tsushima</h1>
		<p>This webpage covers all the lore, game dynamics, scenery, and other details that I liked from this masterpiece. Enjoy, and I hope this page convinces you to give it a try!</p>
	<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is a <em>PS4</em> exclusive game set in 1274 B.C.E. on the tiny island of Tsushima off the coast of Japan. The game covers the Mongol invansion of Japan, which, although highly dramatized and fictionalized here, actually is based off actual events - after most of his ~80 Samurai bretheren are killed on the beach of ___, it is up to Sakai to stop the Mongols before they reach the mainland and save is people while at it. Playing as seasoned Samurai Jin Sakai, players must face a grueling campaign as Sakai saves his uncle, challenges hoards of bloodthirsty Mongols, learns a whole hoast of different fighting stances and weapons, and becomes the Ghost to defeat Khotun Khan. </p>
		<p>Players are also treated to great side stories and a customizable skill tree, weapons menu, adaptable stances, and feature-specific and upgradable outfits. Part of Jin Sakai's character arc is the balance between upholding bushido as a honorable samurai and taking on oni-like attributes as the legendary ghost. Sakai trains with many senseis that affect his viewpoint on these matters, along with making many allies from unlikely places across the island; all of these people help him shape his thoughts on how best to save his community. Sakai must also address his past as the last of the Sakai clan, and the potential successor to Lord Shimura, his uncle and Jito of the island.</p>
		<p>This game was a pleasure to play, a true-love letter to rich story based games, 50s-60s samurai flicks along the lines of Kurosawa's "" </p>
